        <p>
            I am studying a major in Computer Science with minors in Intelligent
            systems and Mobile Applications. This course has exposed me to the new
            technologies available in current industry.
            The use of scrum project development while completing team assignments
            allowed me to help the team by contributing with innovation and structured
            goal orientation.
