                    My current employment has built my skills in rapid accurate data entry.
                    This is conducted on specialized hardware and software to ensure fluid
                    collection and mobility.
                    I have utilized this work to further develop my personal time management
                    while being innovative to increase my productivity.

                    I served in the Australian defense force after leaving high school to
                    give myself the opportunity to exercise my discipline and leadership.
                    While serving I was promoted to the position of Bombardier and became the
                    second in command of a section of soldiers. This required contribution
                    from me to maximize the effectiveness of my team to execute tasks to
                    achieve the desired outcome.
                    This experience cultivated strong work ethics and team dynamics that i can
                    bring to any future employment.

                    I am studying a major in Computer Science with minors in Intelligent systems and
                    Mobile Applications. This course has exposed me to the new technologies available
                    in current industry.
                    The use of scrum project development while completing team assignments allowed me
                    to help the team by contributing with innovation and structured goal orientation.
