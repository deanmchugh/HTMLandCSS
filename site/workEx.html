            My current employment has built my skills in rapid accurate data entry.
            This is conducted on specialized hardware and software to ensure fluid
            collection and mobility.
            I have utilized this work to further develop my personal time management
            while being innovative to increase my productivity.

        <h2>Bombardier</h2>
        <p>
            I served in the Australian defense force after leaving high school to
            give myself the opportunity to exercise my discipline and leadership.
            While serving I was promoted to the position of Bombardier and became the
            second in command of a section of soldiers. This required contribution
            from me to maximize the effectiveness of my team to execute tasks to
            achieve the desired outcome.
            This experience cultivated strong work ethics and team dynamics that i can
            bring to any future employment.
